## 📌 Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
This project uses **machine learning** to analyze patient health data and predict the **probability of heart disease**, helping in early risk assessment.

The application is designed with:
- Simple and clean UI
- Medical feature abstraction (user-friendly)
- Robust backend ML pipeline

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: AdaBoost Classifier  
- **Training Data**: Clinical and lifestyle health indicators  
- **Features Used**: 20 medical & lifestyle features  
- **Target**: Heart Disease Risk (Yes / No)

The UI collects essential inputs while remaining features are safely auto-filled to maintain model integrity.
